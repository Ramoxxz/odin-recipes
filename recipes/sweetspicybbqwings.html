    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Sweet and Spicy BBQ Chicken Wings</strong> is a relatively easy to make recipe that doesn't involve that many
    ingredients, it is easy to find frozen chicken wings in any nearby store and the rest is just applying the sauce and condiments</p> 
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds frozen, ready-to-cook chicken wings</li>
    <li>⅔ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>½ cup red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>¼ cup dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Arrange chicken wings on a grill pan. Cook in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on "Auto Cook" setting 1 until browned, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
